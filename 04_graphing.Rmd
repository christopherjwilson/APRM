## By the end of this section, you will be able to:
 

- Describe the ggplot "grammar of visualisation": coordinates and geoms
- Write a graph function to display multiple variables on a plot
- Amend the titles and legends of a plot
- Save plots in PDF or image formats

```{r import data, include=F}
library(readr)
studentData <- as.data.frame(read_csv("Datasets/studentData.csv"))
```

## The "grammar of visualisation"

 
- Graphs are made up of 3 components:
    * A dataset
    * A coordinate system
    * Visual marks to represent data __(geoms)__

The "grammar of visualisation" #2
 
 ```{r  out.width = "100%", echo=F}

knitr::include_graphics("img/ggplot1.png") 
```
  
  - In the above example, the dataset is the _studentData_ that we used previously.
  - The _grades_ variable is mapped to the X axis
  - The _hoursOfStudy_ variable is mapped to the Y axis

## How to code a graph


- The graph is created using the following code:
```{r  out.width = "100%", echo=F}

knitr::include_graphics("img/ggplot2.png") 
```

- In this code, we specify the dataset, the variables for the X and Y axes and the __geom__ that will represent the data points visually (in this case, each datum is a point)

## The graph output


```{r echo=T}

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data=studentData, aes(x=grades,y=hoursOfStudy)) + geom_point()


```


## Changing the geoms leads to different visualisations


- If we change from points to lines, for example we get a different plot:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data=studentData, aes(x=grades,y=hoursOfStudy)) + geom_line()
```


## It is possible to represent more variables on the plot


- By specifying that colours of our points should be attached to the __route__ variable, the data is now colour-coded

```{r}

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data=studentData, aes(x=grades,y=hoursOfStudy)) + geom_point(aes(color = route))


```

## It is possible to represent more variables on the plot #2

- By specifying that size of our points should be attached to the __satisfactionLevel__ variable, the size of the points adjusts

```{r}

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data=studentData, aes(x=grades,y=hoursOfStudy)) + geom_point(aes(color = route, size=satisfactionLevel))


```

## It is possible to represent more variables on the plot #3


- By specifying that shape of our points should be attached to the __hasDependents__ variable, the shape of the points changes accordingly

```{r}

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data=studentData, aes(x=grades,y=hoursOfStudy)) + geom_point(aes(color = route, size=satisfactionLevel, shape=hasDepdendants))


```

## Plotting summaries of data

- We can summarise the data (e.g. get the mean or sd) using the *stat_summary()* function
- Below we are making a bar chart with the mean grade for each route

```{r}
ggplot(data=studentData, aes(x=route, y= grades, fill=route)) + stat_summary(fun.y = "mean", geom = "bar")
```


## Changing the axis labels and title on a plot

We can change the axis labels and title using the __labs()__ command:

    labs(x="Student Grade", y="Hours of Study", title = "Scattterplot of student data")

```{r}

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data=studentData, aes(x=grades,y=hoursOfStudy)) + geom_point(aes(color = route, size=satisfactionLevel, shape=hasDepdendants)) + labs(x="Student Grade", y="Hours of Study", title = "Scattterplot of studentdata")


```

## Changing the legend on a plot


To change the legend, we use the __labs()__ command too, and reference the relevant property (e.g. size, shape, colour)

    labs(x="Student Grade", y="Hours of Study", title = "Scattterplot of student data", color="Route of study", size="Satisfaction level", shape="Has dependents?")

```{r}

library(ggplot2)

  ggplot(data=studentData, aes(x=grades,y=hoursOfStudy)) + 
    geom_point(aes(color = route, size=satisfactionLevel, shape=hasDepdendants)) +
  labs(x="Student Grade", y="Hours of Study", title = "Scattterplot of studentdata", color="Route of study", size="Satisfaction level", shape="Has dependents?")



```

## Storing plots to be recalled later

- Plots can be assigned to objects in R and recalled later, just like any other piece of data

```{r}

library(ggplot2)

## Create plot and store it as "myPlot" object

myPlot <- ggplot(data=studentData, aes(x=grades,y=hoursOfStudy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = route, size=satisfactionLevel, shape=hasDepdendants)) +
  labs(x="Student Grade", y="Hours of Study", title = "Scattterplot of studentdata", color="Route of study", size="Satisfaction level", shape="Has dependents?")




```

## Recalling a stored plot



```{r}
 #Recall myPlot
myPlot
```


## Saving plots # 1


- Plots can be save using the __export__ button in the plots tab

```{r  out.width = "100%", echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("img/savePlot1.png") 
```

## Plots can also be saved using code


- You might want to include code to save your plot in a script, for example
- This can allow greater control over the output file and plot dimensions:
```{r}
ggsave(plot= myPlot, file="myPlot.pdf", width = 4, height = 4)
ggsave(plot= myPlot, file="myPlot.png", width = 4, height = 4, units="cm", dpi=320)
```
