Mediation analysis example Packages needed Baron and Kenny approach in R Mediation package approach in R 9.2 What is mediation? Where the relationship between a predictor (X) and an outcome (Y) is mediated by another variable (M). In the above model, we theorise that socio-economic status predicts education level, which predicts future prospects. 9.3 What is moderation? There is a direct relationship between X and Y but it is affected by a moderator (M) In the above model, we theorise that socio-economic status predicts future prospects but the strength of the relationship is changed by education level 9.4 Why different models? This might be more appropriate if higher education costs money This might be more appopriate if access to higher education is free 9.5 Mediation analysis 9.5.1 What is a mediation design? Whether a mediation analysis is appropriate is determined as much by the design as by statistical criteria. We must consider whether it makes sense to predict this relationship between variables 9.5.2 What is mediation analysis? Based on regression A summary of the logic of mediation: The direct relationship between X and Y should be significant The relationship between X and M should be significant The relationship between M and Y (controlling for X) should be significant When controlling for M, the strength of the relationship between X and Y decreases and is not significant The direct relationship between X and Y should be significant The relationship between X and M should be significant The relationship between M and Y (controlling for X) should be significant When controlling for M, the strength of the relationship between X and Y decreases and is not significant Baron &amp; Kenny (1986) originally used a 4-step regression model to test each of these relationships. 9.5.3 What packages do we need? library(mediation) #Mediation package library(multilevel) #Sobel Test library(bda) #Another Sobel Test option library(gvlma) #Testing Model Assumptions library(stargazer) #Handy regression tables 9.6 Mediation analysis (the Baron and Kenny Approach) 9.6.1 Conducting mediation analysis (the Baron and Kenny Approach) Baron &amp; Kenny (1986) originally used a 4-step regression model to test each of these relationships.

This example is from Demos &amp; Salas (2019).

Mediated). The ACME here is the indirect effect of M (total effect - direct effect) and thus this value tells us if our mediation effect is significant. fitMed &lt;- mediate(fitM, fitY, treat=&quot;X&quot;, mediator=&quot;M&quot;) summary(fitMed) ## ## Causal Mediation Analysis ## ## Quasi-Bayesian Confidence Intervals ## ## Estimate 95% CI Lower 95% CI Upper p-value ## ACME 0.28159 0.14991 0.42 &lt;2e-16 *** ## ADE -0.11100 -0.30382 0.09 0.260 ## Total Effect 0.17059 0.00862 0.33 0.038 * ## Prop.
