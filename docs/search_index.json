The module is also designed to explicitly prepare you for the two Doctorate level research modules which occur in Years Two and Three of the programme, ensuring that you have the requisite knowledge and skills to successfully engage with those modules. The key foci for this module include: critical review of established literature project design project management data analysis dissemination of research findings The module is taught using a variety of techniques to best enhance your knowledge and understanding of the application of research theory and methods in the context of clinical psychology. These include lectures, seminars, guided statistical analysis and tutorials with the latter being used to provide individual guidance and formative feedback. The module has its own site on the Universitys Virtual Learning Environment http://eat.tees.ac.uk - known as Blackboard), with resources and literature designed to support learning. 1.2 Module timetable and delivery for 2021/2022 At the time of writing, all teaching is planned to take place face to face, on campus. Any adjustments due to the pandemic will be informed by the accreditation standards of the BPS, and in particular, the interim guidance Clinical Psychology training and Covid-19 (2020): this guidance emphasises flexibility and a focus on competencies, rather than a dilution of competencies; and that trainees are still expected to gain the range of experiences outlined in the BPS standards. Any updates regarding course delivery will be provided regularly via https://bb.tees.ac.uk/ so please do check this site frequently. The timetable for this module appears on the Clinical Psychology Programme Site/Timetables. The majority of the sessions will take place on Monday mornings. Please note that the timetable should be checked on a regular basis. 1.2.1 Learning and Teaching Strategies The module is taught using a variety of techniques to best enhance your knowledge and understanding of the application of research theory and methods in the context of clinical psychology. This includes activities designed to encourage independent learning, a key skill for successful performance in research modules in Years Two and Three of the programme. Evidence of independent learning is expected in the assignments for this module. Specific links are made with research informed activity in practice. You will be provided with two papers for critical review at the start of the module and asked to decide which one you will use for your summative critical review assignment; one of these papers is from a quantitative research tradition and the other is from a qualitative research tradition. All presentations (with added annotations) are available, along with additional support materials, via an e-learning@tees on the VLE. E-learning is enabled through group activities on the VLE or Microsoft Teams where discussion and problem solving is undertaken in relation to tasks set during teaching sessions. The discussion boards or Microsoft Teams site will be used to ask and answer questions that arise from the taught material and also your independent work. 1.3 Assessment 1.3.1 Formative assessment Formative feedback is provided throughout the module through practical exercises and in seminars on trainee presentations. By the end of year one, trainees are expected to have identified a thesis topic and have a completed research proposal. As such, there are a number of formative milestones across the year that will be monitored by the module team. Please see Appendix 1 of this guide for details. The required format for thesis research proposals can be found in Appendix 2 of the DClinPsy Programme Research Handbook. The formal formative assessment is of a presentation of the thesis research proposal to be presented during the research panels, which take place in July 2022. The presentation will be 20 minutes long and will outline the thesis project that the trainee will develop in Years 2 and 3. There will also be 10 minutes allotted for questions from the panel which will have two academic members and one clinical member. This formative assessment is intended as a starting point for the Year 2 and 3 research methods modules. The timing is important as it should enable trainees to start the process of ethics approval for their dissertation. earlier. The trainees will hand in a printed copy of their slides with explanatory notes and references. Formative Assessment Criteria The following criteria will be used to assess the assignment: Effective justification for the study. Clearly defined research question. Comprehensive and critical review of the literature (within time constraints). Realistic research design. Effective consideration of ethical issues. Clear plan for writing up and dissemination. Fulfillment of professional research ethics requirements. Adherence to the relevant guidance for presentation as advised by the Module Tutor. 1.3.2 Summative Assessments Assessment consists of an ICA and an ECA, each worth 50% of the overall module mark. The deadlines for these assessments can be found in the assessments section on Blackboard or in the programme assessment timetable. ICA (50%) - A critical review of a published primary research paper (choice to be made by a trainee from papers with different methodologies provided by the tutor). (2,000 words). Learning outcomes: (KU 1-4, CIS 1-3, KTS 1-3) ICA Assessment Criteria (Critical Appraisal of Published Primary Research Paper ) The following criteria will be used to assess the assignment: Demonstrate a critical understanding of the role of the reviewed paper for clinical psychologists in service delivery and/or practice. Demonstrate a critical and comprehensive understanding of the relevant methodological issues. Systematically and critically evaluate stages of the research process. Demonstrate a comprehensive and critical understanding of the ethical issues involved in the research. Reach effectively argued conclusions. Demonstrate independent learning ability through reflection on the critical review process. Adhere to the American Psychological Association (APA) guidelines for presentation and referencing. ECA (50%) - A research project proposal which both addresses limitations identified in the ICA critical review (1) and develops the research further with the use of an alternative methodology (2,000 words). Learning outcomes: (KU 1-4, CIS 1-3, PPS 1-2, KTS 1-5) ECA Assessment Criteria (Research Project Proposal) The following criteria will be used to assess the assignment: Identify a project that demonstrates a detailed and critical understanding of the research evidence reviewed and wider methodological issues, including the role of the project for informing service delivery and/or practice. Provide detailed and appropriately justified solutions to the design of the research project. Consider both methodological and ethical issues in the design of the research project. Demonstrate a detailed and critical understanding of the data analysis required for the proposed study. Adhere to the American Psychological Association (APA) guidelines for presentation and referencing. Suggested structure for ECA This assessment is a research proposal and should be structured to describe the research aims and how the methodological approach suggested will address these aims. The previous assessment will have raised certain critiques of the research paper discussed, and these issues might inform the proposed project. However, it is important that this assessment stands alone as a written piece of work, so there should be sufficient information and reference to literature for the reader to understand the basis of the research question and methodological choices that are made (similar to when someone reads a dissertation or research paper method). In terms of strucutre, there are some elements that it would be logical to include: A brief introduction A statement of the research question(s) and (if appropriate) hypotheses Information about planned sampling approach / participant inclusion and exclusion criteria An overview of the proposed method, including information about measures and techniques that would be used An overview of the planned analysis It would also be useful to include, though not necessarily in an independent section information about: the clinical relevance/impact of the research ethical considerations that need to be taken into account. 1.3.3 Word limits for assessment Word limits are as stated above (note that there is no allowance of +10%). The word count refers to the assignment itself and does not include the reference list or tables/graphs. The references cited in the main body of text are included in the word count. 1.3.4 Submitting work All work should be submitted electronically, using the apporpriate links on the module Blackboard site. A printed hard copy of the assignment is not required and should not be submitted. The universitys policy is that all assessments must be submitted by 4 p.m. on the day of the deadline. 1.3.5 A note about referencing There is an expectation that all academic assignments conform to current American Psychological Association referencing and citation conventions. Poor referencing will be taken into consideration when marking. It is recommended that you use a digital reference management system (e.g., Refworks, Mendley), which are freely available (and will save you time). The following online resources are also useful: http://reciteworks.com/ - good for checking fine details (e.g., missing references) http://www.apastyle.org - detailed guidance for APA style https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/- additional advice for APA style 1.4 Statistical analysis software You may be familiar with SPSS from your undergraduate statistics teaching. Please note that we do not use SPSS for teaching and instead use R Statistics. The reason for this is that R is a free statistical package, meaning that it can be accessed in NHS settings that do not have funding for SPSS. This will enable you to run statistical analyses whilst on placement where required, and also enables you to conduct statistical analyses as a qualified Psychologist without incurring any software costs. R is also more flexible than SPSS and has greater functionality. During the teaching you will be shown how to set up and install R, and how to run statistical analyses in this software. 1.4.1 Downloading R and R Studio software You can obtain R and R Studio from the following links: https://cran.r-project.org/ https://rstudio.com/ 1.5 Texbooks that can be accessed online e-books can be accessed from the library website: https://www.tees.ac.uk/depts/lis/ 1.5.1 Research Methods and Statistics Coolican, 2019.

You are advised to read around the area of your thesis topic on a continuing basis, and make use of tutorials with your supervision team when needed. It is also advised that you consider research governance and ethics as you develop your project. Please speak to your academic supervisor about this as they will be able to advise or direct you to someone with appropriate expertise to address queries. As specified in the Research Handbook, please note that a revised version of your research proposal forms one of your year two summative assignments. The deadline for this assignment is early on in the start of second year and it is therefore advised that you work on your revised proposal as soon as you receive feedback from the panels and have discussed this with your academic supervisor.
