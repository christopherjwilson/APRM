The module is also designed to explicitly prepare you for the two Doctorate level research modules which occur in Years Two and Three of the programme, ensuring that you have the requisite knowledge and skills to successfully engage with those modules. The key foci for this module include: critical review of established literature project design project management data analysis dissemination of research findings The module is taught using a variety of techniques to best enhance your knowledge and understanding of the application of research theory and methods in the context of clinical psychology. These include lectures, seminars, guided statistical analysis and tutorials with the latter being used to provide individual guidance and formative feedback. The module has its own site on the University’s Virtual Learning Environment http://eat.tees.ac.uk - known as Blackboard), with resources and literature designed to support learning. 2.1 Module timetable and delivery for 2020/2021 The timetable for this module appears on the Clinical Psychology Programme Site/Timetables. The majority of the sessions will take place on Monday mornings. Please note that the timetable should be checked on a regular basis. Due to COVID19 pandemic, the sessions for this module will be delivered online in 2020/21 2.2 Learning and Teaching Strategies The module is taught using a variety of techniques to best enhance your knowledge and understanding of the application of research theory and methods in the context of clinical psychology. This includes activities designed to encourage independent learning, a key skill for successful performance in research modules in Years Two and Three of the programme. Evidence of independent learning is expected in the assignments for this module. Specific links are made with research informed activity in practice. You will be provided with two papers for critical review at the start of the module and asked to decide which one you will use for your summative critical review assignment; one of these papers is from a quantitative research tradition and the other is from a qualitative research tradition. All presentations (with added annotations) are available, along with additional support materials, via an e-learning@tees on the VLE. E-learning is enabled through group activities on the VLE or Microsoft Teams where discussion and problem solving is undertaken in relation to tasks set during teaching sessions. The discussion boards or Microsoft Teams site will be used to ask and answer questions that arise from the taught material and also your independent work. 2.3 How will the online sessions work?

["assessment.html", "Section 3 Assessment 3.1 Formative assessment 3.2 Summative Assessments 3.3 Submitting work 3.4 A note about referencing", " Section 3 Assessment 3.1 Formative assessment Formative feedback is provided throughout the module through practical exercises and in seminars on trainee presentations. By the end of year one, trainees are expected to have identified a thesis topic and have a completed research proposal. As such, there are a number of formative milestones across the year that will be monitored by the module team. Please see Appendix 1 of this guide for details. The required format for thesis research proposals can be found in Appendix 2 of the DClinPsy Programme Research Handbook. The formal formative assessment is of a presentation of the thesis research proposal to be presented during the research panels, which take place on 20, 21 and 22 July 2020. The presentation will be 20 minutes’ long and will outline the thesis project that the trainee will develop in Years 2 and 3. There will also be 10 minutes allotted for questions from the panel which will have two academic members and one clinical member. This formative assessment is intended as a starting point for the Year 2 and 3 research methods modules. The timing is important as it should enable trainees to start the process of ethics approval for their dissertation. earlier. The trainees will hand in a printed copy of their slides with explanatory notes and references. Formative Assessment Criteria The following criteria will be used to assess the assignment: Effective justification for the study. Clearly defined research question. Comprehensive and critical review of the literature (within time constraints). Realistic research design. Effective consideration of ethical issues. Clear plan for writing up and dissemination. Fulfilment of professional research ethics requirements. Adherence to the relevant guidance for presentation as advised by the Module Tutor. 3.2 Summative Assessments Assessment consists of an ICA and an ECA, each worth 50% of the overall module mark. The deadlines for these assessments can be found in the assessments section on Blackboard or in the programme assessment timetable. ICA (50%) - A critical review of a published primary research paper (choice to be made by a trainee from three papers with different methodologies provided by the tutor). One of these papers is from a quantitative research approach, one from a qualitative research approach and the third will use mixed methods (2,000 words). Learning outcomes: (KU 1-4, CIS 1-3, KTS 1-3) ICA Assessment Criteria (Critical Appraisal of Published Primary Research Paper ) The following criteria will be used to assess the assignment: Demonstrate a critical understanding of the role of the reviewed paper for clinical psychologists in service delivery and/or practice. Demonstrate a critical and comprehensive understanding of the relevant methodological issues. Systematically and critically evaluate stages of the research process. Demonstrate a comprehensive and critical understanding of the ethical issues involved in the research. Reach effectively argued conclusions. Demonstrate independent learning ability through reflection on the critical review process. Adhere to the American Psychological Association (APA) guidelines for presentation and referencing. ECA (50%) - A research project proposal which both addresses limitations identified in the ICA critical review (1) and develops the research further with the use of an alternative methodology (2,000 words). Learning outcomes: (KU 1-4, CIS 1-3, PPS 1-2, KTS 1-5) ECA Assessment Criteria (Research Project Proposal) The following criteria will be used to assess the assignment: Identify a project that demonstrates a detailed and critical understanding of the research evidence reviewed and wider methodological issues, including the role of the project for informing service delivery and/or practice. Provide detailed and appropriately justified solutions to the design of the research project. Consider both methodological and ethical issues in the design of the research project. Demonstrate a detailed and critical understanding of the data analysis required for the proposed study. Adhere to the American Psychological Association (APA) guidelines for presentation and referencing. 3.2.1 Word limits for assessment Word limits are as stated above (note that there is no allowance of +10%). The word count refers to the assignment itself and does not include the reference list or tables/graphs. The references cited in the main body of text are included in the word count. 3.3 Submitting work All work should be submitted electronically, using the apporpriate links on the module Blackboard site. A printed hard copy of the assignment is not required and should not be submitted. The university’s policy is that all assessments must be submitted by 4 p.m. on the day of the deadline. 3.4 A note about referencing There is an expectation that all academic assignments conform to current American Psychological Association referencing and citation conventions. Poor referencing will be taken into consideration when marking. It is recommended that you use a digital reference management system (e.g., Refworks, Mendley), which are freely available (and will save you time).

However, there are 4 main sections, 2 on the left and 2 on the right. MAIN TOP: R Script files or R Document Files Where we usually type our code as a script before we run it. Script files are usually saved so we can work on them and rerun the code again later (.R files). MAIN BOTTOM: Console Shows the output of our R code. We can type R code directly into the console and the answer will ouput immediately. However, it is more convenient to use script files. RIGHT TOP: Environment Contains all of the objects (e.g. data, analysis, equations, plots) that are currently stored in memory. We can save all of this to a file and load it later (.RData files). RIGHT BOTTOM: File Browser The folder that R is working from is called ‘the working directory’ and it will automatically look for files there if we try to import something (e.g. a data file). Using the more button on the file browser allows you to set your desired working directory. 7.6 Working with a script Scripts can be opened from the File menu. Creating a new script The purpose of scripts is to allow you to type your analysis code and save it for use later. Scripts include, for example: Code for importing data into R Your analysis code (e.g. t-test or descriptive statistics) Code for graphs and tables Comments and notes (preceded by the ‘#’ symbol) Example of an R script To run a script, you click the Run button. You can choose to: Run the whole script Run the selected line of code The run button When you run the script, you will normally see output in the console. Output appears in the console If your script contains code for a plot (graph), it will appear in the Plots window in the bottom right. Plots appear in the plot window 7.7 Installing and loading packages install Packages from RStudio, Inc. on Vimeo. Packages add functionality to R and allow us to do new types of analysis. They can be installed via the menu (Tools -&gt; Install Packages) The can also be installed using code: install.packages() For example, TidyR is a package that contains functions for sorting and organising data. To install the package: Installing a package in RStudio or use the code: install.packages(“tidyr”) Once a package is has been installed, you need tp load it using the library() command.

For example, we might do some analysis: mean(happiness) However, in the example above, the result would appear in the console but not be saved anywhere. To store the result for reuse later, we save it to an object: happinessMean &lt;- mean(happiness) In the above code (reading left to right): We name the object “happinessMean”. This name can be anything we want. The arrow means that the result of the code on the right will be saved to the object on the left. The code on the right of the arrow calculates the mean of happiness data When this code is run, happinessMean will be stored in the environment window: Result of a calculation in the environment To recall an object from the environment, we can simply type its name. For example: happinessMean Its important to note that anything can be stored as an object in R and recalled later. This includes, dataframes, the results of statistical calculations, plots etc. 8.5 Identify different data structures and variable types 8.5.1 Data structures There are many different types of data that R can work with. The most common type of data for most people tends to be a dataframe. A dataframe is what you might consider a “normal” 2-dimensional dataset, with rows of data and columns of variables: A dataframe example R can also use other data types. A vector is a one-dimensional set of values: # a vector example scores &lt;- c(1,4,6,8,3,4,6,7) A matrix is a multi-dimensional set of values. The below example is a 3-dimensional matrix, there are 2 groups of 2 rows and 3 columns: ## , , 1 ## ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 3 5 ## [2,] 2 4 6 ## ## , , 2 ## ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 7 9 11 ## [2,] 8 10 12 We will primarily work with dataframes (and sometimes vectors), as this is how the data in psychology research is usually structured. 8.5.2 Variable types With numerical data, there are 4 key data types: Nominal (a category, group or factor) Ordinal (a ranking) Interval (scale data that can include negative values) Ratio (scale data that cannot include negative values) R can use all of these variable types: Nominal variables are called factors Ordinal variables are called ordered factors Interval and ratio variables are called numeric data and can sometimes be called integers (if they are only whole numbers) or doubles (if they all have decimal points) R can also use other data types such as text (character) data. 8.5.3 Convert variables from one type to another When we first import data into R, it might not recognise the data types correctly. For example, in the below data, we can see the intervention variable : ## participant intervention happiness ## 1 15 2 7.155174 ## 2 1 1 7.636446 ## 3 9 1 7.825854 ## 4 13 2 8.027635 ## 5 20 2 8.688806 ## 6 4 1 8.762067 ## 7 5 1 8.808865 ## 8 2 2 8.956439 ## 9 16 2 9.550301 ## 10 6 1 9.573987 In the intervention variable, the numbers 1 and 2 refer to different intervention groups. Therefore, the variable is a factor variable. To ensure that R understands this, we can resave the intervention variable as a factor using the as.factor() function: happinessSample$intervention &lt;- as.factor(happinessSample$intervention) 8.6 Working with dataframes 8.6.1 Order, filter and group data 8.6.2 Create new variables from data "],
["using-regression-instead-of-anova.html", "Section 9 Using regression instead of ANOVA 9.1 Analysis of covariance", " Section 9 Using regression instead of ANOVA People are often taught to use ANOVA to compare groups (i.e. if you have a categorical IV) and regression if you have continuous IVs. However, ANOVA and regression are the same thing, so it is possible to use regression to do analysis instead of ANOVA or ANCOVA. However, it might be difficult to understand how this is, so let’s look at an example. The dataset Baumann compares 3 different methods of teaching reading comprehension. For this example, we will just look at the variable post.test.1 as the DV. 9.0.1 ANOVA Approach ANOVA asks the question in the following way: Is there a difference in reading comprehension scores between teaching groups? The analysis takes the following approach: What are the means of groups 1,2 and 3? Are the means of groups 1,2 and 3 different? Is the difference in means of groups 1,2 and 3 statistically significant? If we were to summarise the data, we might present it in the following way: ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument) group mean sd Basal 6.681818 2.766920 DRTA 9.772727 2.724349 Strat 7.772727 3.927095 In Table @ref(tab:data_summary) can see that the mean scores are different and highest in the DRTA group. If we were to run an ANOVA on the data, we might present it in the following way: term df sumsq meansq statistic p.value group 2 108.1212 54.06061 5.317437 0.0073468 Residuals 63 640.5000 10.16667 NA NA Notice that the ANOVA (Table @ref(anova_approach)) tells us that the difference between groups is significant (p &lt; 0.05) but we cannot tell yet which of the 3 groups are significantly different from each other. 9.0.2 Regression approach Regression asks the question the following way: Does teaching group predict reading comprehension score? The analysis takes the following approach: Let’s use the mean of group 1 as a reference point (i.e. the intercept). What’s the difference between the intercept and the mean scores of the other groups (i.e. the coefficients)? Are any of the coefficients statistically significant? If we run a regression analysis, we might present the results like this: R2 0.1444271 term df sumsq meansq statistic p.value group 2 108.1212 54.06061 5.317437 0.0073468 Residuals 63 640.5000 10.16667 NA NA term estimate std.error statistic p.value (Intercept) 6.681818 0.6797950 9.829167 0.0000000 groupDRTA 3.090909 0.9613753 3.215091 0.0020583 groupStrat 1.090909 0.9613753 1.134738 0.2607841 If we look at the coefficient (estimate) for the intercept (see Table @ref(tab:regression_approach)), we can see that the value is the same as the mean of the Basal group in the previous section (Table @ref(tab:data_summary)). Furthermore, if we look at the estimates of DRTA and Strat, we can see that the values are the difference between their mean score, and the score for of the intercept (BASAL) group.

That is, we need statistical approaches to test hypotheses because we can only collect data from samples of the population but our research questions and hypotheses apply to whole populations. For that reason, we need a way to estimate how well the sample reflects the population. It is common for us to want to know what the mean (average) response of the population is on certain measures. For example, we might ask the question “what is the average score on this measure of happiness?”. In reality we can only measure a subset (sample) of the population, so we test as many people as we can. Below is a sample of 20 participants: Table 10.1: Some sample data for happiness score participant intervention happiness 1 1 7.636446 2 2 8.956439 3 1 11.224307 4 1 8.762067 5 1 8.808865 6 1 9.573987 7 2 14.136543 8 2 11.246481 9 1 7.825854 10 1 10.251354 11 1 9.871752 12 2 11.852558 13 2 8.027635 14 1 11.881459 15 2 7.155174 16 2 9.550301 17 2 11.227291 18 2 9.710584 19 2 11.073627 20 2 8.688806 10.2 Variance in sample data influences our confidence in population estimates We can see from the table above that the mean of the sample is 9.8730765. However, this is not to say that the population mean is 9.8730765. For one thing, we can see that the range of scores in the sample is between 7.1551736 and 14.1365426. The standard deviation of the sample is 2. The fact that there is so much variance from person to person within our sample indicates that we are likely to be incorrect if we assume that the sample mean is the same as the population mean. The more variance there is within the sample data, the less confident we can be that the sample mean is an accurate representation of the population mean. Another thing that affects our ability to generalise from sample to population is that the sample size is only 20. Larger samples are less influenced by individual outliers, so the larger the sample size is, the more confident we can be that the sample mean is representative of the population mean (provided that the participant sample is representative of the population and recruited in a way to minimise bias). The standard error of the mean can be calculated to estimate how far the mean of the sample data is likely to be from the true population mean. It uses the concepts of variance and sample size to make this estimate. Standard error is calculated by dividing standard deviation by the square root of the sample size (\\(SE = \\frac{SD}{\\sqrt{\\left[n\\right]}}\\)) In R, we can calculate the standard error of the happiness data like so: standardError &lt;- sd(happiness)/sqrt(length(happiness)) ## Calculate standard error standardError #Display the standard error ## [1] 0.3909348 The standard error of our sample mean is 0.39. This suggests that using the sample mean is likely to be 0.39 away from the population mean. 10.3 We can use confidence intervals to make educated guesses about the population mean Using the standard error, we can also create Confidence intervals, which are a range of values, within which the population mean is likely to fall. For example, we know from normal distribution that 95% of the population lies between +/- 1.96 standard deviations of the mean. If we use our sample mean (\\(\\bar{x}\\)) in place of the population mean and include the standard error to account for errors in our estimate, we come up with the following formula for 95% confidence intervals of the mean: Lower confidence interval = \\(\\bar{x} - 1.96*SE\\) Upper confidence interval = \\(\\bar{x} + 1.96*SE\\) mean(happiness) - 1.96 * standardError # Lower confidence interval ## [1] 9.106844 mean(happiness) + 1.96 * standardError # Upper confidence interval ## [1] 10.63931 The value of 1.96 come from the normal distribution, where 95% of the population lies between +/- 1.96 standard deviations of the mean. If we did not already know this, we could use the qnorm() function in R to calculate the value: # Calculate the number of standard deviations that contains 0% to 97.5% of the data (100% - 2.5%). # We can then say that 95% of the data lies between + or - the answer: qnorm(0.975) ## [1] 1.959964 However, with smaller samples, since we are less confident about generalising to the population, we use the t-distribution to calculate that value. The shape of a t-distribution changes based on the sample size, so the smaller the sample size is, the wider the range that 95% of values lie between. We can calculate the 95% value for a particular sample size in R using the qt() function: # The qt function relates to t-distribution qt(0.975,df=20-1) ## [1] 2.093024 # for qt, we need to specify the degress of freedom, which is sample size minus 1 We can see that when we have a sample size of 20, 95% of values in our predicted population distribution will lie between + and - 2.0930241 standard deviations. Therefore, we can calculate more accurate confidence intervals using this value: mean(happiness) - qt(0.975,df=20-1) * standardError # Lower confidence interval ## [1] 9.054841 mean(happiness) + qt(0.975,df=20-1) * standardError # Upper confidence interval ## [1] 10.69131 This tells us: if we were to take infinite number of similar samples, about 95% of their confidence intervals would contain the population mean. Therefore, we think it is reasonable to estimate that the population mean is somewhere in this range. Often people say that a 95% confidence interval means that there is a 95% chance that the population mean is between the lower and upper confidence interval. This is not an accurate statement, but it is often used as a shorthand to help people conceptualise what confidence intervals are. 10.4 We can also make confidence intervals of differences between means Often when we test hypotheses, we are testing the difference between two samples. For example, we might have 2 groups who have undergone different psychological interventions and want to know whether the difference we see our participant samples is likely to generalise to the population.

An important part of interpreting this, is to notice whether any point between these values is equal to zero. If the confidence interval of a difference contains a zero value, this means that in future research, with similar samples, it would be possible to see zero difference between the groups. If, on the other hand, the confidence interval does not cross zero, then it is likely that in future research, with similar samples, we would see some difference between the means. The fact of whether confidence intervals cross zero (or not) is linked directly to the idea of hypothesis testing and statistical significance. 10.5 The null hypothesis and statistical significance Using the same study from the previous example: we know that the null hypothesis can be phrased as “in the population, there is no difference between groups”. We then see how the confidence interval of a difference can help us test the null hypothesis: if the null hypothesis were not true, then it is unlikely that the confidence interval of the difference would contain zero. t.test(data= happinessSample, happiness ~ intervention) ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: happiness by intervention ## t = -0.79402, df = 17.794, p-value = 0.4376 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -2.226907 1.006060 ## sample estimates: ## mean in group 1 mean in group 2 ## 9.537343 10.147767 "]
